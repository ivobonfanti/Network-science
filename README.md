# Network-science

The project concerns the study of global migration via network analysis.
For each of the year considered a weighted and directed graph is built, reporting countries as nodes and the number of migrants as edgesâ€™ attributes. 
A comparison between the metrics of the different resulting networks tries to capture the evolution of the phenomena over a thirty-year period. 
Specifically, the parsed statistics are the weighted degree, both in and out, and the partitioning in communities. 
The graphs are first constructed using Python and then visualized and compared with Gephi.
